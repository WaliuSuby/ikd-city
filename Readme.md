i am just doing little test on myself 
it is said that practice makes perfect
   Bihiznillah T'allah i will be a genius at web development i believe
   my site was not found on the server was told it was because of the capital letter on the spelling of my index.html
   am not still not getting a solution to my site 404
Alhamduliahi i finally found a way to finally go live on my site ,initially i changed the "Index.html" to small letter and i added, commit and pushed to github
Despite doing that it did'nt still have an effect on the github i was worried and kinda frustrated
Then i started making research on it i still didnt find a solution, so i just typed on my whatsapp meta on what the problem is though i initially went there for solution buh with diffrent tip buh did'nt get what i wanted so i typed what i was facing there ,
So it brought out a git command to force the capital letter to rename to small letter which is "git mv -f Index.html index.html" 
Then i added and commited the file then boom it reflected on my remote , then the site opened though te site does not near good buh Allhamdulilahi am gaining knowledge i knw nothing about a month ago
